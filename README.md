# FlowTow â€“ COMP2110 Web Design Project

A redesigned and visually improved version of a photo-sharing web application. This project was completed as part of the COMP2110 unit at Macquarie University. The original layout was provided, and the task was to enhance the interface using modern HTML and CSS techniques.

## About the Website

FlowTow is a fictional photo-sharing platform showcasing user-submitted images and popular posts. It features a clean layout, structured content sections, and basic form elements such as a registration area.

The project required a complete front-end redesign while retaining core components like the navigation bar, welcome header, post feed, and sign-up form. The final design balances accessibility, aesthetics, and layout structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** HTML, CSS
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Fonts:** Nunito (Google Fonts)
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code
- **Design Considerations:** Color accessibility, visual spacing, and UI consistency

## My Role

I independently handled all aspects of the redesign, including:

- **Layout Rebuild:** Completely rewrote the HTML and CSS for the front page.
- **UI Improvements:** Implemented card-style shadows instead of borders, refined button styles, and ensured consistent white backgrounds across sections.
- **Responsiveness** Improved sidebar and main content behavior to align properly.
- **Accessibility & Readability:** Ensured contrast, text legibility, and semantic HTML were prioritized.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Ensured all posts had appropriate spacing and that the sidebar sections aligned in height with the content area.

## Challenges Faced

- **Legacy Markup** The provided HTML had structural limitations requiring a full rewrite.
- **Overflow Issues:** Removing unwanted scrollbars and content restrictions while preserving responsiveness.
- **Sidebar Alignment:** Matching the sidebar height with dynamic content required layout experimentation.
- **Design Consistency:** Ensuring a clean, modern feel without overcomplicating the original concept.
- **Design Choices:** As someone still developing my design instincts, I initially found the number of possible layout and styling directions overwhelming. Narrowing down a cohesive visual style that felt balanced and modern was a genuine challenge.

## Key Learnings

- **UI Refinement:** Improved understanding of visual hierarchy, spacing, and form styling.
- **CSS Layouts:** Strengthened my grasp of box models, shadows, fixed heights, and flex/grid alignment.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Learned to rewrite HTML while maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.
- **Design Eye:** Developed a sharper sense of UI polish and user flow.
